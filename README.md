# Aquarium
A small aquarium project I'm working on using SDL2 and c++. A x86 release build can be found here: https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApOH5Od3tcbAlXX9-u3M5eQhd4ok?e=N8jCcF
Here is a sample video showing the current state of the project as of 11/10/2020: https://i.imgur.com/wLTGsFH.mp4

# Developer's note
Although the project could be improved in quite a few areas with some effort, mostly regarding exceptions with heap memory management(cleanup) in Graphics(probably use smart pointers, didn't bother) and small performance tweaks(mostly regarding collision vectors), as well as some code "cleanliness". Although I know of these issues, this project can use up to around 3500~ elements before there's any real resemblance of a performance hit so I believe this is enough for the scope of this project.

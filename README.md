# Aquarium
A small aquarium project using SDL2 and c++. This project contains self made rectangle collision detection and resolution as well as redirection based on angle of collision. No other libraries were used beside SDL2. 

# Developer's note
Although the project could be improved in quite a few areas with some effort, mostly regarding exceptions with heap memory management(cleanup) in Graphics(probably use smart pointers, didn't bother) and small performance tweaks(mostly regarding collision vectors), as well as some code "cleanliness". Although I know of these issues, this project can use up to around 3500~ elements before there's any real resemblance of a performance hit so I believe this is enough for the scope of this project.
